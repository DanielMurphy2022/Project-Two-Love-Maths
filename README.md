Rock Paper Scissors Game is a fun interative game which aims for any age group to enjoy and ave some fun. It has nice bright colors, easy to use and extremely easy to play all you need to do is click and play against the computer!

Features
Its a game that consists of one page viewed by the user. It has 3 pages by the developer which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user would only see the front end landing page which consists of the game, bright colors and easy to play game against the computer.

The landing page for the game is very easy, it shows the name, buttons to choose from rock, paper or sccissors. The page will also show the score if you win or lose, also showing if you tie with the computer.

Unfixed Bugs
My Favicon wont work with gitpod, it works on VS code on my laptop just not on gitpod. I left this as a comment, the files will not be accepted in favicon in assets folder just says error it originally worked but since I pushed it it hasn't worked.

Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub. Live site is here; https://danielmurphy2022.github.io/Project-Two-Love-Maths/

Credits
My site I used some external help, such as favicon from favicon.io since changing to gitpod though it hasn't worked. The code was taken directly from them. Huge thanks to the slack community as I wasn't aware of the gitpod change from codeanywhere a big shout out to Kenan for making me aware of this. Hude credit to the Code institute course as the detail in the modules were absolutely excellent preparing me for this project and made me understand JavaScript a lot more, the comparitive programming module gave me a lot of information because I was somehow overwhelmed thinking all programming would work but showed me there is some differences, as before I would have put some other language in if I couldn't get the code to work.

Content
The content written by me was from my own doing, The favicon code is directly from them. I also had help with the JavaScript currently in college doing something similiar so my notes came in excellent for this.

Media
There is no media, only the Favicon which wont work for me.
